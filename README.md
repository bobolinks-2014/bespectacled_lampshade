## PROBLEM
Choosing a new vehicle is difficult.  Separate to such esoteric features such as styling, fabrics, and bluetooth capabilities, the long term cost of gas consumption is an important, yet difficult to understand piece of the decision process.

## SOLUTION
Our site helps users simplify the process of buying a car by providing them with a better understanding of the true cost of owning a car.  Users can input their home and work addresses, then choose a vehicle.  The site will calculate the round trip commute distance and return a fuel cost by day, month and year.

## UI Details
Users do not need to login to use the site
Vehicle details are pulled from the US Government - http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml
Distance is pulled from the Google Maps API

## Future Features
Compare multiple vehicles
Choose locations on embedded Google Map
